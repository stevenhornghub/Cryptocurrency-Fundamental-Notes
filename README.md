# Cryptocurrency-Fundamental-Notes
Learn about Blockchain, cryptocurrency, mining terminologies, miners, user nodes, different kinds of wallets, forks, attacks, scams on cryptocurrency and token.


Notes #1
Cryptocurrency- A vitual or digital currency in which transactions are virified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.

Advantages :
• Difficult to steal if you do not give away your private key
• Protected from governments and central authority
• Immune to government interference and manipulation
• Incredible investment opportunity because of high volatility

Blockchain-Technology behind cryptocurrency. History of all transactions of a decentralized community

Types of Cryptocurrency
• Bitcoin
• Ethereum
• Altcoins

Relationships between Traditional monet and Cryptocurrency

FIAT Money vs Cryptocurrency

Mining is the tool to tell whether something happened or not.

Full nodes-Receives information from users and shares these information with the network
Users or Light Nodes- Most people in the crypto community who just use the crypto currencies to trade or pay

Validating nodes - Produce the blocks for the blockchain. Confirm the blocks that should be put into the list

Miners- These people created the initial consensus and make sure that all transactions are TRUE. They discover new cryptocurrency coins.

Transaction - You use a private key to sign a transaction, which means that you type in another public address where you want to send the money.
Wallet App- Wallet app distributes this information to surrounding miners and nodes.
Nodes & Miner Distribution - Nodes and miners distribute this information even further an exponential process.
Checking - Every miner and node checks whether the transaction is correct.

Three ways to control miners:

1. Proof of Importance (POI)The most meaningful/reliable miners get the biggest share of all transaction fees Like on twitter: The more followers you have, no more influence you have -> Fraud may occur
2. Proof of Stake (POS)The more you control the system the bigger your share PROBLEM: How decentralized is such a system? Might be solved with voting power: You for instance stake 1000 coins in 100.000 coin system, you get 1% voting power
3. Proof of Work (POW)Most widely used proof Whoever does the work first, will get the money

Hash Rate:
1. Hash rate is the speed at which a computer is completing an operation in the bitcoin code. A higher hash rate is better when mining as it increases your opportunity of finding the next block and receiving the reward.

Different types of Mining Computers
Type 1. CPU-Mining – running through an average computer processor, hash rate 1 million – 2,8 million per second (virtually doesn’t exist anymore, too ineffective)
Type 2. GPU- Mining – hashing calculations much more effective, hash rate 35-55.000.000 per second (for Bitcoin virtually non-existing anymore, no positive ROI)
Type 3.ASIC Mining – computers specifically for bitcoin mining, giga-tera hash rate per second

SEGWIT
• 2007 Bitcoin update • Helped the blockchain to scale (more users)
• Decrease size of transactions, not of blocks

Note #2
3 Types of pre cryptocurrency Money
1. Commodity Money - Earliest Money
2. Gold and Silver
3. Representative Money - Our money today generation.

Inflation and Depreciation
A significant problem with any commodity or representative money system (as well as fiat money, which
we'll discuss below) is inconsistent supply. A country's economy can become only as large as its reserves.
Therefore, if no new gold, silver or other resource is discovered, either at home or in some weaker
country, the economy can't grow to ma

Cryptography.
It’s used to secure all kinds of data that's sent over the internet.

Cryptography Basics
In a nutshell, cryptography replaces passwords with keys. The process really isn't difficult to understand,
once you're familiar with a few basic concepts. Let’s start with some definitions:
• Encryption: Taking a readable message, or plaintext, and turning it into a random-looking string
of characters that can't be read, called ciphertext.
• Decryption: The reverse of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
• Algorithm: In mathematics and computer science, a series of finite and well-defined instructions
that solve a problem.
• Hashing: An algorithm used to reduce data to a representative value (like a fingerprint or index)
in order to verify that it hasn’t been modified.
• Key: A sequence of characters used by a cryptographic algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data.
• Breaking: Figuring out how to decrypt ciphertext without the key.

Public Key Cryptography
A far more secure form of cryptography, public key cryptography, is asymmetric; the encryption and
decryption keys are different, but mathematically related. There's a public key, which can be shared with
anyone, and a private key, known only to the sender. Together, they're called a key pair.
Here's how Alice would send Bob a message using public key cryptography:
• Bob sends Alice only his public key.
• Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt her message into ciphertext, which she sends to Bob.
• Bob uses his private key to decrypt her message.
• Eve might intercept Bob's public key and Alice’s message, but she doesn’t have Bob’s private
key to decrypt it.

Cryptocurrency Wallets
Originally, a cryptocurrency wallet referred to the public and private key pair for a particular coin. The
term has come to mean any hardware device, application, piece of paper or service that can store these
keys. The key pair lets you send and receive cryptocurrency.

Hash Functions
A hash function is an algorithm that operates on some input data (the message) to create an output, called
a fingerprint, digest, or hash. Blockchains like Bitcoins use a special kind of algorithm called a
cryptographic hash function. However, it's important to first understand how a basic hash function works.

Addresses
Cryptocurrency must be received by an address. The blockchain network ensures that funds are
transferred only between the addresses provided.
Addresses are calculated by performing two hash functions on a public key.

Digital Signatures
A traditional ink-on-paper signature provides terrible security. Not only can it be copied and used in other
places, but also there's no way to know if a signed document was modified later. This is also true for
“electronic signatures,” which are either graphics of handwritten signatures pasted into an electronic
document or “signature” fields in which you type a name.

What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin has been called a digital currency, cryptocurrency or digital gold.

What is a Smart Contract?
The term smart contract is somewhat inaccurate; smart contracts aren’t very smart, and they have no
legal status anywhere. It was coined by cryptographer Nick Szabo, defined as a “set of promises,
specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises.”
More concisely, it’s an agreement in digital form that is self-executing and self-enforcing.

Cryptocurrency Security
In addition to the privacy concerns mentioned above, there are somewhat overlapping issues of
security. Unlike a bank, which protects your assets with thick-walled vaults, armed guards, multiple
computer backups and deposit insurance, cryptocurrency holders must assume full responsibility for
making sure that their assets aren’t lost or stolen; there is no Bitcoin Customer Service number to call!

Note #3
Blockchain Technology

Digital ledger - nothing more that a recorded digital file.
Publicly records all transactions - Each financial transaction is publicly recorded and visible to everyone, which makes the whole process transparent trustworthy and reliable.

Sequential =the transactions are recorded in a chronological order
Secure = They are securely stored
Permanent = once they are recorded, they cannot be changed
Ever-expanding chain= forming a connected chain of transactions that continues to grow and expand
cryptography = a highly sophisticated mathematical problem solving method to hide, secure and lock the information contained in it.
Hash-linked blocks = block of files linked to each other by highly advanced algorithms (hash-linked)

Why Blockchain is important?
Blockchain is revolutionizing the method of transferring money using a decentralized peer-to-peer approach, meaning person to person.
